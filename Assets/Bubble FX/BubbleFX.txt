Bubble FX by Archanor VFX
=================

This asset features different scenes filled with bubbles, godray and dust particle effects.

The prefabs can be dragged & dropped into your scene and are easiest to scale up with Transform.

Created for the built-in render pipeline with an upgrade included for URP/Universal.


=================
Usage
=================

Demo scenes contain a 'BubbleCanvas' prefab as well as an EventSystem which are used for the scene selection menu in the bottom right.

These can simply be deleted. If you want to use the scene selection menu, you first have to add the demo scenes to Build Settings.
